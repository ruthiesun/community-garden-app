UBC SS 2022 CPSC 304 group project. Uploaded from local copy.

An app catered to community gardeners where users can locate community gardens on a map, interact with other users in a forum, look up plants with an advanced search feature, and view plant care details. 

My code can primarily be found in src/main/java/plant, along with sections of code in src/main/java/controller, src/main/java/database, and src/main/java/delegates that support the plant lookup functionality of the app from front end to back end.
